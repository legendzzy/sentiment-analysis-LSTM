python version: 3.7 or higher

python library:
torch https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
spacy https://spacy.io/usage#installation
dill https://dill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#
torchtext https://github.com/pytorch/text

Usage: Run main.py, and input the sentence you want to predict the sentiment. 
Then the result (positive or negative) will be shown with a confidence from 0 to 1.
If the confidence > 0.5, then it means a positive one; or it means a negative one.

For example: input (The experience here is awesome)
The output will be: cofident score: 0.984828, positive

The files LSTM-model-10.pt, text_vocab and label_vocal should be put in the same path with main.py.
split_partial_reviews.py are used to do data reprocessing,
sentiment_rnn.py are used to train the model and generate the vocabulary needed,
LSTM-model-10.pt, text_vocab and label_vocal are generated by sentiment_rnn.py.
We just need to run main.py to use the application.
